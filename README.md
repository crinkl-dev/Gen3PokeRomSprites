## About
This repository is a sprite resource for Gen 3 ROM hacks.

## Collaborators
If you would like to contribute your own sprite files, create an Issue ticket under Issues that says "Requesting Access". I will then either approve or deny that request. The main branch is protected and all contributions will have to be made on a separate branch. All pull requests are set to require a review from me. Any inappropriate pull requests will result in the removal of collaborator access.
